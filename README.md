# BetterNob1e

Welcome! This project and website exist for one reason only: to prank my partner's friend Nob1e. If you’re reading this, you probably already figured that out (or you’re Nob1e, in which case: gotcha!).

There’s no grand purpose, no deep technical showcase, and definitely no serious business here. Just a bit of fun and some lighthearted trolling.

## What’s inside?

- A homepage that looks way more official than it should.
- A mysterious button that leads to enlightenment (or something like it).
- A journey through some classic internet shenanigans.
- A final escape, if you’re clever enough (patient enough really) to find it.

## Why?

Because sometimes, the best reason to build something is just to make your other people laugh (and maybe groan a little).

## Credit

Fae made me do it. :)
